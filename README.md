## This was an introduction course to DirectX11 with C++

# Lab 1
* Make a raytracer that could export an image of a scene of object
* Sending rays from the "camera" to the objects (plane, sphere, triangle and oriented boundingbox)
* stb_image_write.h was used as an extern library to write the final image

Final image

# Lab 2
* Make a basic 3D-renderer that could render a moving quad
* Learned the basic pipeline
* stb_image.h was used as an extern library to read the textures

Final 3D renderer
